    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer:** The best scenario is the max_depth = 3. We can see that the green line (testing score) increases with training points and reaches ~0.8, so it generalizes well. In the other hand, the red line (training score) decreases a little with the training points but it stills fit the dataset well: there seems to be no high bias or high variance problem, although more training points would help it become an even better model.\n",

Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "\n",
    "Both training and testing scores are low. There is barely a gap between the training and testing scores. This indicates the model is not fitting the dataset well and not generalizing well: underfitting!\n",

    "* What intuition lead you to this answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "**Answer:** I think that it is the maximum depth of 3. The gap between the training score and testing score is basically null and both scores are around 0.8. So we can say that there is no bias or variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the exercise, I realized that the accurate answer would be 4. It also makes sense, the gap between the training score and testing score is not that relevant and the training score is greater."

    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** When explaining the Grid Search technique, be sure to touch upon why it is used,  what the 'grid' entails and what the end goal of this method is. To solidify your answer, you can also give an example of a parameter in a model that can be optimized using this approach."
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "**Answer:** In essence, the grid search technique allows one to define a grid of parameters that will be searched using K-fold cross-validation. Importantly, the grid search technique exhaustively tries every combination of the provided hyper-parameter values in order to find the best model. One can then find the highest cross-validation accuracy that matches with the corresponding parameters that optimizes the learning algorithm."

    "\n",
    "* What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? \n",
    "\n",
    "* What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** When explaining the k-fold cross validation technique, be sure to touch upon what 'k' is, how the dataset is split into different parts for training and testing and the number of times it is run based on the 'k' value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the [docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation) for your answer."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "**Answer:** The k-fold cross-validation splits the dataset into K \"folds\" of equal size. Then, each fold acts as the testing set 1 time, and acts as the training set K-1 times. Then, the average testing performance is used as the estimate of out-of-sample performance, also known as cross-validated performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of k-fold cross-validation are:\n",
    "1. More reliable estimate of out-of-sample performance than train/test split;\n",
    "2. Reduce the variance of a single trial of a train/test split;\n",
    "3. Hence, with the benefits of k-fold cross-validation, we're able to use the average testing accuracy as a benchmark to decide which is the most optimal set of parameters for the learning algorithm;\n",
    "4. If we do not use a cross-validation set and we run grid-search, we would have different sets of optimal parameters due to the fact that without a cross-validation set, the estimate of out-of-sample performance would have a high variance;\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, without k-fold cross-validation the risk is higher that grid search will select hyper-parameter value combinations that perform very well on a specific train-test split but poorly otherwise."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.20/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.model_selection` to create a grid search object.\n",
